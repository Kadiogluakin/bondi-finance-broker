# Vanke Credit Rating Report

## Executive Summary
China Vanke Co., Ltd., one of China's leading real estate developers, faces a challenging market amid a prolonged property sector downturn. Using our Bond Spectrum Model, we conducted a credit assessment of Vanke, resulting in a score of 48, which places it in the Yellow Zone in our color-coded system.

The Vanke bond (XS2078641888) currently offers a yield of 20.74%, significantly higher than comparable U.S. corporate bonds and sovereign yields. This yield reflects both the bond's attractive risk premium and the market's perception of Vanke's refinancing risks and foreign currency debt exposure.

## Financial and Operational Context
Vanke operates in over 60 cities across China, primarily focusing on residential development. A recent 23% month-on-month sales rebound, driven by state-backed initiatives, has provided short-term support. However, the company still faces USD 3.4 billion in debt repayments in 2024, with persistent liquidity pressures and a high proportion of foreign currency debt posing critical financial risks.

## Positive Indicators
- **Government Support**: A RMB 2.8 billion loan from state-owned Shenzhen Metro and the appointment of Xin Jie (Shenzhen Metro's chairman) to a key management position signal strong government backing and efforts to mitigate default risks.
- **Early Redemption Measures**: Announced plans to redeem certain bonds early, bolstering investor confidence in Vanke's ability to meet near-term obligations.

## Key Vulnerabilities
- **Foreign Currency Exposure**: A substantial portion of Vanke's debt is USD-denominated, exposing the company to currency risk, particularly if the U.S. dollar strengthens.
- **Liquidity Concerns**: Despite government support, ongoing asset sales and weakening sales performance highlight persistent liquidity challenges, especially with large bond maturities looming in 2025.

## Key Financial Metrics (in thousands of CNY)
- Operating Income: 4,478,891
- Working Capital: 265,444,418
- Retained Earnings: 75,673,003
- Total Assets: 1,357,179,783
- Total Liabilities: 982,821,342

## Yield Spread Adjustment

### Calculation Details
- Vanke Bond Yield (XS2078641888): 20.74%
- Comparable U.S. Corporate Bond (Landsea Homes, B-rated): 8.68%
- China Sovereign Yield (10-Year CNY Bonds): 1.78%
- U.S. Treasury 10-Year Yield: 4.242%

### Sovereign Spread
a = U.S. Corporate Yield - U.S. Treasury Yield
= 8.68% - 4.242% = 4.438%

b = China Sovereign Yield - U.S. Treasury Yield
= 1.78% - 4.242% = -2.462%

### Benchmark Yield
Benchmark = a + b + U.S. Treasury Yield
= 4.438% - 2.462% + 4.242% = 6.218%

### Yield Spread
Yield Spread = Vanke Bond Yield - Benchmark
= 20.74% - 6.218% = 14.522% (1,452.2 basis points)

### Adjustment Factor
Adjustment = (Yield Spread (bps) ÷ 1,000 bps) × 1.52
= (1,452.2 ÷ 1,000) × 1.52 = +2.21 points

## Rating Interpretation
A Bond Spectrum Score of 48 corresponds to the Yellow Zone in our color-coded system. This reflects a balance between Vanke's strong market position and the risks associated with its foreign currency debt obligations and emerging market exposure.

## Conclusion
Vanke's score acknowledges the company's operational resilience and liquidity buffers while highlighting its refinancing risks and emerging market challenges. The bond's current yield of 20.74% offers a compelling premium for investors seeking higher returns.
