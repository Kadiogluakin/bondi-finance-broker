Legal Opinion on whether Bondi Technology Inc. is engaging in regulated activities under
Panama's Legal Framework

Executive Summary

Cryptocurrency activities: In Panama, there is no current regulation governing crypto-related activities,
with no specific framework governing Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) or crypto-related
operations. This position has been formally established through multiple regulatory opinions and
notices from both the Superintendency of Securities Market (SMV) and the Superintendency of Banks
of Panama (SBP), which explicitly confirm that cryptocurrencies fall outside their regulatory
jurisdiction. The legal foundation for this approach stems from Panama's constitutional principle of

Panama, January 22, 2024

Legal Opinion on whether Bondi Technology Inc. is engaging in regulated activities under
Panama's Legal Framework

Executive Summary

Cryptocurrency activities: In Panama, there is no current regulation governing crypto-related activities,
with no specific framework governing Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) or crypto-related
operations. This position has been formally established through multiple regulatory opinions and
notices from both the Superintendency of Securities Market (SMV) and the Superintendency of Banks
of Panama (SBP), which explicitly confirm that cryptocurrencies fall outside their regulatory
jurisdiction. The legal foundation for this approach stems from Panama's constitutional principle of
legality, which permits individuals or entities to engage in any activity not explicitly prohibited by law.
Under the current framework, virtual assets service providers may operate without obtaining licenses
or regulatory approvals from financial, banking, or securities authorities. This allows for a range of
services, including tokenization of securities, trading operations (spot, derivatives, margin), yield-
generating activities (staking, farming, lending), token-related services (issuance, distribution,
airdrops), and advanced financial products (NFT marketplaces, DeFi integration).

AML/STR Requirements: Activities related to virtual assets, such as tokenization and offering or
distribution of these tokens, are not designated as regulated/reporting entities under Panama's AML
framework (Law 23 of 2015). Consequently, they aren't required to register with AML authorities nor
subject to suspicious transaction reporting obligations. Furthermore, the Financial Analysis Unit (UAF)
has confirmed that such entities cannot voluntarily submit suspicious transaction reports, as they fall
outside the scope of regulated entities.

Sanctions Regime: Panama maintains a two-tiered sanctions compliance framework. “Restrictive lists”
comprise the UN Security Council sanctions lists. Other international sanctions lists (OFAC, UK,
Canada) are incorporated as "Control Lists" for risk assessment and compliance purposes.

I. Introduction

I, the undersigned, Teresa Carballo, licensed attorney, admitted to practice law in the Republic of
Panama and am a partner in Pacifica Legal Civil Society. Our main field of expertise at Pacifica Legal
concerns the legal aspects of blockchain technology and digital assets, including corporate structuring,
regulatory compliance, and related agreements.

We have been engaged by Bondi Technology Inc., a Corporation registered under the Mercantile
Section of the Panamanian Public Registry under number 155761778 (the “Entity”’), to provide a legal
opinion to determine whether the activities performed through their site https://www.bondifinance.io/,



=== Page 3 ===

and related applications (“Bondi”) are considered regulated under the Panamanian Legislation, where
they are domiciled.

This Legal Opinion is limited and relates solely to the regulations of the Republic of Panama as of the
date of this Legal Opinion. This Legal Opinion is confined to matters of Panamanian laws and is given
on the basis that it will be governed by and construed by the laws of the Republic of Panama. Therefore,
we do not express or imply any opinion whatsoever as to any laws other than the laws of the Republic
of Panama and I have made no investigation of any other laws which may be relevant to the documents
submitted to us.

These statements on the Panamanian regulation discussed in this Legal Opinion have been given based
on my interpretation of the relevant provisions, current practice, and the opinions issued by various
authorities, including the Superintendency of Securities Markets of Panama (SMV) and
Superintendence of Banks of Panama (SBP) stated in their respective documents, and accordingly,
where I provide a statement in this Legal Opinion, I’m expressing this analysis, but this does not
guarantee that a court or any other regulatory authority of Panama would necessarily come to the same
view or conclusion.

II. Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this legal opinion is to determine if the activities performed by Bondi, a protocol that
tokenizes bonds, offers and distributes them to users, and generally activities that involve crypto assets,

are regulated activities or subject to any licensing, specifically:

1. Whether engaging in custodial or non-custodial crypto asset services, including, but not limited
to, the conversion of crypto assets to fiat currency, fiat currency to crypto assets, and the
conversion of one crypto asset to another constitutes a regulated activity under the laws of the
Republic of Panama and is subject to licensing or regulatory requirements.

2. Whether the tokenization of securities and the offering or distribution of tokenized securities
constitute a regulated activity under the laws of the Republic of Panama and are subject to
licensing or regulatory requirements.

3. Whether a Panamanian legal entity providing a platform for custodial or non-custodial crypto
asset transaction services or a securities tokenization platform is subject to Panamanian anti-
money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations, including
whether such entities are required to register with or be overseen by Panamanian AML
authorities.

4. Whether listing Bondi's offered services and products within a mobile application on the Apple
App Store and Google Play Store requires any regulatory requirements, licenses, or approvals.

Ill. Legal Framework, Regulations, and Opinions in the Republic of Panama pertinent to this
Legal Opinion

A. Legal Concept and Taxonomy of Crypto Assets

Regulators and decision-makers may consider several elements when determining the legal status and
nature of a particular virtual asset or token. This includes its purpose, use case, technical layer,
underlying value, utility, fungibility, distribution mechanism, level of decentralization, and whether
there is an expectation of profit or whether any asset or FIAT currency backs it.

The notion, concept, and criteria to determine what constitutes a virtual asset have evolved and it varies
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. However, there is a general distinction in the industry between “coins”
as assets that live in their native blockchain, and “tokens” as assets that exist foreign to the blockchain


=== Page 4 ===

they live on. Furthermore, it has been generally accepted by the legal and field industry the following
classification standards:

e Cryptocurrencies are cryptographically secured digital representations of value or contractual
rights that can be transferred, stored, and traded electronically.

e Security tokens can represent rights or interests in a business, such as ownership, equity,
repayment of a specific sum of money, or profit sharing. They may also be transferable
securities or financial instruments.

e Utility tokens can be redeemed for access to a specific product or service that is typically
provided using a Distributed Ledger Technology platform. They are usually accepted as
payment for particular goods or services.

e Governance tokens: are crypto assets that represent voting power and decision-making rights.

e = Asset-backed tokens resulted from the tokenization of assets. Instead of trading the asset itself,
the token is traded.

e Stablecoins are designed to minimize volatility. Their value is pegged to a stable asset, such as
fiat currency.

e Non-fungible tokens are unique, non-interchangeable cryptographic assets stored on a
blockchain.

The uses and characteristics of these "tokens" vary, the most common classification being the one that
differentiates between two types or categories: a) Security tokens: they generally grant participation in
future income or the increase in value of the issuing entity or a business; b) Utility tokens: they give the
right to access a service or receive a product”.

According to author Miguel Estruch Ferrando, “The term utility token refers to the class of crypto tokens
whose essential purpose is to perform a specific function in a specific (crypto) ecosystem and, in this
way, allow users of a specific network or platform to perform some type of action... This type of token
grants a right to use a service provided by the issuer, which does not necessarily have to be provided in
the blockchain ecosystem, although this is usual. From this point of view, utility tokens are like a right
over a product or service and, thus, "would be similar to reward crowdfunding: I contribute and get a
service, which normally consists of access to certain applications based on blockchain.”

Security tokens, for their part, are crypto tokens that constitute negotiable securities and, as such, grant
rights of an economic nature over the corresponding projects. This would be the case, for example, of
a token that grants the right to participate in the benefits of the project in which it is invested or, even
simply, to receive an interest rate on the capital invested in it.

Furthermore, beyond national initiatives, there have been efforts by intergovernmental organizations
such as UNIDROIT to pursue the harmonization of laws about digital assets. UNIDROIT, an
organization to which Panama has not adhered, defines digital assets under the UNIDROIT Principles
on Digital Assets and Private Law. Accordingly, this soft law instrument defines a digital asset as
follows: ‘Electronic record’ means information that is (1) stored in an electronic medium and (ii) capable
of being retrieved, and (2) ‘Digital asset’ means an electronic record which is capable of being subject
to control.

There is currently no legal definition of cryptocurrencies, crypto assets, or tokens in the Republic of

Panama, as this matter remains unregulated in the country. Despite this fact, it is noteworthy to examine
the proposed crypto bill (Bill No. 697 of 2021), now declared unenforceable and unconstitutional

(“inexequible”) by the Supreme Court of Justice, by its decision dated June 6, 2023, to discern the
legislative intent behind the regulation of such assets. The crypto bill project explained in its preamble,
is a blockchain as a decentralized database where each transaction or interaction is recorded. In it, no
person or entity has the power to unilaterally delete or manipulate the information. This ensures that the


=== Page 5 ===

information is secure, accurate, and transparent. Subsequently, article 3 (4) defined a “blockchain” as a
type of distributed ledger technology that connects blocks of transactions through a decentralized
cryptographic consensus mechanism. Additionally, Article 3 (6) defined a “crypto asset’ as a “fungible
or non-fungible digital entry in a distributed ledger that can be a blockchain or not, whose ownership
can be proven using cryptography and whose transfer can be made through digital signatures that make
use of cryptography. Although there may not be specific laws in place governing cryptocurrencies at
present, analyzing the provisions outlined in the proposed bill can provide insights into the government's
approach and attitudes toward this evolving asset.

Furthermore, we can cite the notice issued by the Superintendency of Securities Market on April 25,
2018, where this authority states that cryptocurrencies are digital assets that are intended to make
purchases, sales, or other financial transactions, they are created by companies or individuals and are
stored electronically in a blockchain, a database that maintains a permanent record of these digital
transactions. Further, it states that cryptocurrencies have no legal framework in the Republic of Panama.
Therefore, they are under no supervision of a financial regulatory authority or securities regulator in the
Republic of Panama. Although this statement issued by the Superintendency of the Securities Market
may only constitute a notice rather than a legally binding law, it nonetheless offers valuable insight into
the regulator's stance on cryptocurrencies.

On the other hand, if we analyze the existing legislation currently in force in the Republic of Panama,
it becomes apparent that the current legislation can also offer guidance on the categorization of such
virtual assets. As virtual assets are part of a decentralized public ledger that represents the right of a
person, they could be delimited under the current Panamanian Legislation through Civil law. Under
Article 326 of the Panamanian Civil Code, “movable property” is defined as property susceptible to the
appropriation that can be transported from one point to another without impairing the real estate to
which they were attached, rights, and obligations. Under Article 327, it is further stated that shares,
even if they are mortgage-based, that have as their object sums of money or movable effects are also
considered movable property; shares and participation quotas in commercial or civil companies, even
when they own real estate, and incomes and pensions. They also have the characteristic of being
intangible, as they only exist electronically. The Panamanian Civil Code stipulates that movable
property, or assets encompass all items susceptible to appropriation. Additionally, rights or obligations
are regarded as "property" in their own right. Given that crypto assets reside within a decentralized
public ledger (blockchain), representing the entitlement of an individual, they ought to be classified as
intangible "movable property." Characterized by their electronic existence, crypto assets possess the
defining trait of intangible "movable property.”

B. Constitutional Law

The Panamanian Constitution, in Article 18, states that “Private persons are solely responsible to the
authorities for violation of the Constitution or the Law. Public officers are responsible, for the same
reasons, and for exceeding their authority, or for dereliction in the performance of their duties.”

It establishes the legal principle that allows individuals to do everything that the law does not prohibit.
In contrast, for the authorities, the principle of legality is prioritized, as the authorities can only do what
the law expressly authorizes them to do. The Panamanian Constitution, based on this legal principle,
empowers individuals to undertake actions not explicitly prohibited by law. Conversely, for authorities,
the principle of legality takes precedence, dictating that they may only exercise powers explicitly
conferred upon them by law. This dichotomy delineates the boundaries of permissible conduct for both
individuals and governing bodies within the legal framework of Panama.


=== Page 6 ===

Based on this precept, we commence this document indicating that the base of the Panamanian
legislation mentions that the opposite of what is forbidden is what is allowed.

Another important concept we will further analyze in this Opinion is the Principle of Territoriality, in
Article 3 of our Constitution, it is established that “The territory of the Republic of Panama comprises
the land surface, the territorial sea, the submarine continental shelf, the subsoil, and the airspace between
Colombia and Costa Rica following the boundary treaties concluded between Panama and these States."

A legal analysis of the Principle of Territoriality determines that Panamanian individuals, Panamanian
Legal Entities, not their property, are an extension of the territory of the Republic of Panama.

Following this analysis and the established principle that what is not expressly prohibited is permitted,
as I will further analyze, the activities performed by Bondi fall within the scope of legally permissible
activities under Panamanian law, given that current Panamanian legislation does not explicitly prohibit
them, and that Panamanian individuals and legal entities may engage in activities not expressly
forbidden by law, it appears to be compatible with the Panamanian legal framework.

C. Banking Law

Executive Decree 52 of 2008 (the “Banking Law”) establishes that: “Any person is prohibited from
raising, in or from the Republic of Panama, directly or indirectly, resources from the public through the
acceptance of money on deposit or any other modalities, unless: (a) he has a license or authorization for
the activity issued by an authority or regulatory entity competent by law, or (b) engages in recruitment

activities that are expressly exempted by law from the requirement for a license, regulation, or
authorization.”

In light of the aforementioned legal provision, it is imperative to conduct a thorough analysis to
determine whether the activities in question fall outside the scope of activities requiring licensure under
the Banking Law; and if so, whether these operations qualify for any statutory exemptions from
licensing, approval, regulatory, or authorization requirements.

The Banking Law of Panama does not explicitly regulate crypto assets services due to its fundamental
design and scope. The law was conceived and structured to regulate traditional banking activities,
specifically, those entities that engage in the business of banking, as defined in Article 3 of the Banking
Law. This definition centers on three core banking functions: accepting deposits from the public,
utilizing such resources for lending or investment purposes, and providing traditional payment services
as an ancillary function to these core banking activities. Crypto assets transaction services, which
primarily facilitate the exchange between cryptocurrency and fiat currency or between different
cryptocurrencies, do not engage in any of these core banking activities and thus fall outside the law's
intended regulatory scope.

The absence of licensing provisions for crypto assets-related services in the Banking Law is not an
oversight but rather a consequence of its limited scope. The licensing regime established under the law
is specifically designed for entities engaging in banking business as traditionally defined. Article 16 of
the law grants the Superintendency of Banks (SBP) authority to issue technical standards and establish
requirements, but this authority is explicitly limited to entities conducting banking business. The law
contains no provisions for licensing or supervising entities that provide only crypto assets exchange or

' Executive Decree No.52 that adopts the Unified Text of Decree Law 9 of 1998, modified by Decree Law 2 of
2008.


=== Page 7 ===

transaction services without engaging in deposit-taking or lending activities. This creates a regulatory
void for crypto asset transaction services and other crypto asset providers who operate outside the
traditional banking model.

This regulatory gap has become increasingly significant as financial technology has evolved. While the
Banking Law provides the SBP with certain powers to issue technical standards for the banking sector's
operations, these powers do not extend to establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for
payment gateways. The law's silence on payment gateway services reflects its traditional focus and
highlights the need for separate legislation specifically addressing modern payment services.

After a thorough review of the Banking Law, it is concluded that the scope of the legislation does not
extend to the regulation of crypto assets transaction services. The Banking Law does not specifically
address or govern cryptocurrency transaction services, and as such, it does not impose any explicit
licensing obligations on entities providing such services within the Republic of Panama

D. The Remittance Law

Law 48 of 2003, hereinafter referred to as the "Remittance Law," establishes the regulatory framework
governing Money Remittance Houses within its jurisdiction. The scope of this legislation encompasses
activities related to the transfer of monetary funds, explicitly including, but not limited to, operations
conducted through various systems of fund transfers, transmission mechanisms, clearing processes, or
any other means of transferring money, both domestically and internationally. This comprehensive
definition aims to capture all forms of money remittance activities, thereby ensuring a robust regulatory
environment for entities engaged in such financial services.

After a thorough review of the Remittance Law, it is concluded that_this legislation does not impose a
licensing or regulatory requirement on entities engaging exclusively in crypto assets transaction
services. The Remittance Law narrowly applies to entities involved in the direct transfer of monetary

funds through formalized systems of transmission, clearance, or similar mechanisms, both domestically
and internationally. Crypto assets transaction services, involving the exchange of crypto assets to fiat

or between different crypto assets, do not fall within this scope. In this sense, it is concluded that the

scope of the legislation does not extend to the regulation of crypto assets transaction services. The

Remittance Law does not specifically address or govern cryptocurrency trading activities, and as such,
it does not impose any licensing or registration requirements on entities providing crypto assets trading
services within the Republic of Panama

E. Securities Regulations

Panama’s securities regulation in the Unified Text of the Securities Market of Panama’ defines the term
“Security” under article 49 (66) as: “Any bond, negotiable commercial title or debenture, share
(including treasury shares), trading right recognized in a custody account, participation quota,
certificate of title, trust certificate, deposit certificate, mortgage bond, warrant, or any other instrument
or right usually recognized as security or security determined as such by the Superintendence.”

Said meanings do not include the following instruments:

? The Unified Text of the securities market in the Republic of Panama and the Superintendency of the Securities Market, that comprises
the Decree-Law 1 of 1999 and the laws amending it, including Law 67 of 2011, (modified by Law No. 12 of 3 April 2012 and Law No. 56 of 2
of October 2012); and the Law 66 of 2016. [Gazette No.26979-A 23 February 2012].


=== Page 8 ===

1. Non-negotiable certificates or titles that represent obligations issued by banks to their customers
as a part of their usually offered banking services, such as non-negotiable certificates of deposit.
This exception does not include negotiable bank acceptances or negotiable commercial
securities issued by banking institutions.

2. Insurance policies, certificates of capitalization, and similar obligations issued by insurance
companies.

3. Any other instruments, title so, or rights, which have been determined by the Superintendence
as not being securities.”

Furthermore, the Unified Text defines a financial asset under article 49 (2) as follows: “Any security,
cash, and any other movable property, which an intermediary may keep in a custody account in favor
of a given person if the intermediary and said person have agreed to recognize the said movable
property as a financial asset subject to Title X of this Law [the Unified Text], provided that said movable
property has not been excluded from said meaning by the Superintendence.”’

It also defines an “Offer” under Article 49 (41) as follows: “Jt is a statement, a proposal, or an
expression made to sell, transfer, or dispose of securities in exchange for the payment of consideration
as well as any request intended at inducing a person to make an offer to purchase securities for
consideration. Said expression does not include preliminary negotiations among an issuer or an

,

affiliate thereof and offerers with a view to a public offer...”’;

Moreover, Article 128 of the Unified Text states that “Public offers or sales of securities to be made by
an issuer or an affiliate or by an offerer in the Republic of Panama shall be registered with the
Superintendence unless they are exempted from such registration by the provisions of this Decree-Law
and its regulations.” Additionally, “An offer or sale made to persons domiciled in the Republic of
Panama shall be deemed to be an offer made in the Republic of Panama, regardless of whether it is
made from the Republic of Panama or from abroad unless the Superintendence determines otherwise.
The offer or sale made to persons domiciled outside of the Republic of Panama shall not be deemed to
be an offer made in the Republic of Panama, even if it has been made from the Republic of Panama.
The Superintendence may, by an agreement, determine when an offer made on the Internet should be
understood as an offer may to persons domiciled in the Republic of Panama.”

Other relevant definitions for this Legal Opinion are:

Investment Advisor: A person who, for a fee, is engaged in the business of advising others regarding
the determination of the price of securities or the advisability of investing in, buying, or selling securities
or financial instruments, or in preparing and publishing studies or reports on securities and advising on
Forex. This term does not include accountants, lawyers, teachers, or other professionals whose
investment advice is merely incidental to the exercise of their profession, nor editors, producers,
journalists, writers, commentators, and other employees of newspapers, magazines, publications,
television, radio companies, or other media, as long as such persons only issue opinions or views as
part of their employment or position in the media, do not have or acquire an interest, directly or
indirectly, in the securities on which they issue opinions or views, and do not receive commission or
payment for these, except for the ordinary remuneration for their position or employment in said media.

Brokerage Firm: A person engaged in the business of buying and selling securities or financial
instruments, on behalf of others or their account. This also includes the offering and opening of
investment accounts.

Only those who have obtained the corresponding license issued by the Superintendency may engage in
the business of brokerage firms or investment advisors in the Republic of Panama or from it, regardless



=== Page 9 ===

of whether such persons provide services in connection with securities that are registered with the
Superintendency or not.

Private Investment Company: An investment company managed in the Republic of Panama or from
it, whose participation shares are not offered in the Republic of Panama, and whose social pact, trust
instrument, or constitutive document contains one of the following provisions: a. That limits the number
of actual owners of its participation shares to fifty or requires offers to be made through private
communication and not through public media. That stipulates that its participation shares can only be
offered to qualified investors in minimum initial investment amounts of one hundred thousand balboas
(B/. 100,000.00). Private investment companies will not be considered registered investment companies
and will not be subject to the provisions of the Law of the SMV

Qualified Investors: Natural or legal persons whose ordinary course of business includes the
negotiation, on their behalf or on behalf of others, of securities or assets of the type that make up the
investment portfolio of an investment company, a hedge fund, or a significant part of these, or who have
signed a declaration stating that they possess, individually or together with their spouse, a net worth of
no less than one million balboas (B/.1,000,000.00) or its equivalent in another currency and consent to
be treated as a qualified investor, they must invest no less than USD 100,000.

The Agreement 5-2004 regarding Investment Companies and Investment Managers, establishes the
procedure for authorization and license applications and the rules for their operation and functioning.

This Agreement applies to Investment Companies, Investment Managers and Custodians:

1. An Investment Company is defined as any legal person, trust, or contractual arrangement that,
through the issuance and sale of its participation shares, is engaged in the business of obtaining
money from the investing public, through single or periodic payments, with the aim of investing
and trading, either directly or through investment managers, in securities, currencies, metals
and inputs, real estate, or any other goods determined by the Commission. Excluded from the
scope of application are: Investment Companies whose group of investors is limited to a number
that does not exceed twenty (20) persons determined by their membership in a company or an
association, and provided that there are no marketing or distribution activities or public offering
of their shares, as well as those Companies in which their participation shares have been
distributed under a contract between its participants, in which the entry of new investors is
prohibited.

2. Investment Managers are those persons to whom an investment company delegates,
individually or in conjunction with other persons, the power to manage, handle, invest, and
dispose of the securities and assets of the investment company. Investment managers may
provide administrative services to investment companies, but the mere provision of such
administrative services, such as accounting, secretarial, domicile or director services,
shareholder relations management, payment, registration and transfer, and other similar
administrative services, does not constitute the person providing them as an investment
manager.

3. Custodians are those persons who maintain custody over the money, securities, or assets of
another person.

Investment Companies that must be registered with the National Securities Commission include:

1. Those that publicly offer their participation shares in the Republic of Panama.

A public offering of securities is understood to exist whenever the conditions established in Decree-
Law No. | of 1999 and its regulatory agreements are met. In any case, there will be a public offer when


=== Page 10 ===

the Investment Company or its Investment Manager, or another entity on behalf of one of them, offers
the securities carrying out advertising activities in the territory of the Republic of Panama.

Advertising activity is any form of communication directed at investors to promote the subscription or
acquisition of participation shares of an investment company. In any case, there is advertising activity
when the means used to address the public is through telephone calls initiated by the issuer or offeror,
home _ visits, personalized letters, email, or any other computerized means, that_are part of a
dissemination, marketing, or promotion campaign. The campaign will be understood to be carried out
in national territory whenever it is directed at persons domiciled in Panama. In the case of email or any
other computerized means, it will be presumed that the offer is directed at persons domiciled in Panama
when the issuer or offeror, or any person acting on their behalf in the computerized medium, proposes
the purchase of the securities or provides to persons domiciled in Panamanian territory the necessary
information to appreciate the characteristics of the issue or offer and adhere to it.

2. Those that are managed in the Republic of Panama or from it, unless they are considered as
private Investment Companies.

An Investment Company will be considered to be managed in the Republic of Panama or from it if any
of the following circumstances occur:

a. The Investment Company designates an Investment Manager in the Republic of Panama.

b. The main domicile of the Investment Company is located in the Republic of Panama, or the
prospectus or other advertising material indicates that it is located in the Republic of Panama.

c. The Investment Company designates a Custodian in the Republic of Panama.

d. The number of directors necessary to adopt a resolution of the board of directors of the Investment
Company (or of trustees or proxies with similar powers) have their domicile in the Republic of Panama

It is relevant to understand that:

An Investment Company will NOT be considered as managed in the Republic of Panama or from it
merely because one or more of the following circumstances occur:

a. The Investment Company is formed or constituted by the laws of the Republic of Panama.

b. The Investment Company has a domicile in the Republic of Panama, if this is not its main domicile
and from the prospectus or advertising material it uses it is not inferred otherwise.

c. One or more of its directors, dignitaries, trustees, proxies, or employees have their domicile in the
Republic of Panama, provided that the number of them necessary to make decisions of the investment
company is not domiciled in the Republic of Panama.

d. Administrative services, such as accounting, secretarial, registration and transfer, and other similar
services, are provided to the Investment Company in the Republic of Panama or from it.

The National Securities Commission may determine whether or not the requirement of management in
or from Panama is met, in each case, given the aforementioned criteria and others that it may establish
in the Agreement.

The following Opinions from the Superintendence of the Securities Market are highly relevant as they
are the only binding criteria that the Panamanian Government has had towards crypto assets.

F. Opinions of the Superintendency of the Securities Market (SMV)


=== Page 11 ===

Opinion 7 of the 15th of November 2018 exempts the Superintendency of the Securities Market from
competency regarding its supervision and recognizes virtual assets are not securities or foreign
currencies under Panamanian regulations by stating the following:

“the exchange or negotiation would be of virtual currencies, using bitcoin as "currency," we must
state that considering bitcoin as a currency would not be possible, since to date, in the Republic of
Panama, bitcoin, or any other type of cryptocurrency, has not been given any inherent value. Given the
foregoing and in responding to the first question, a company that engages in the activities described
does not need to communicate or notify the Superintendency of the start of its activities.”

“By what is established in numeral 66 of article 49 of the Unified Text cited, whose wording was
previously cited, the concept "value" does not cover coins and/or virtual currencies, therefore, in
response to your second question, Bitcoin cannot be considered as a security. This Superintendency, by
a statement issued on April 25, 2018, referred to cryptocurrencies as "digital assets that are intended to
carry out purchases, sales or other financial transactions, are created by companies or individuals and
are stored electronically in a blockchain, a database that keeps a permanent record of these digital
transactions."

Woe

“* ..to date, there is no regulation that contemplates cryptocurrencies as a "value," "money" or electronic
currency, as well as a regulation of forex using cryptocurrencies, and as an exclusive and incidental
activity of the Brokerage Houses, "nor specific regulation on technological platforms”

“Can you operate this business in Panama without a license and/or supervision? Currently, we must
indicate that carrying out this type of activity, as we have already expressed, has not been regulated.
Therefore, it would not require any type of license, nor would it be subject to supervision by this
Superintendency of the Stock Market...”

Under the binding opinion detailed above, the powers of the SMV must be exercised by the express
mandate of Decree-Law No. | of 1999 and Law No. 67 of 2011. In other words, to establish its
competence, the Superintendence must, first of all, determine in the face of a transaction in the local
market whether it is in the presence of security, which is the main object of said regulation. If the
transaction under analysis does not involve the offer or sale of securities, the SMV lacks the competence
to act. Hence, the definition of what constitutes security is of enormous importance to this government
entity, stock market participants, and the investing public. As mentioned in the previous opinion and
repeated statements, the Superintendence is not an authority empowered by law to receive or process
representative issuance of cryptocurrencies or tokenization.

Also, in the SMV’s Opinion 1-2023, the following queries are elevated to the authority:

Topics: Determine the businesses and activities that a Securities House, with a license issued by the
Superintendency of the Securities Market of Panama, can carry out about or with, digital assets of all
kinds, including digital currencies, answering the following questions:

iF Can a Securities House with a license issued by the Superintendency of the Securities Market
of Panama custody all types of digital assets?

2. Can the same Securities House offer and provide its clients with the service of managing
investment accounts opened and maintained by the client with other intermediaries if such accounts
allow holding a portfolio of digital assets?

3. If authorized to engage in the Forex business, can the same securities house conduct transactions
to acquire, sell, or exchange traditional currencies for digital currencies, and vice versa?


=== Page 12 ===

4. Can the same Securities Household cash positions in digital currency, safeguarded in the cash
account that the Securities House maintains in a financial institution (banking, stock exchange) that is
regulated and operates in a jurisdiction that has recognized the digital currency?

The Superintendence responded as follows:

“Finally, regarding the specific concerns expressed in the request, considering the current regulations,
it is necessary to refer to Opinion 7-2018, issued by this Superintendency, specifically related to the
case of the cryptocurrency known as "bitcoin", in which the following was stated:

"

Under the provisions of numeral 66 of article 49 of Unified Text, whose content was previously cited,
the concept of "value" does not encompass coins and/or virtual coins. Therefore, in answer to your
second question, Bitcoin cannot be considered value.

This Superintendency, in line with a statement released on April 25, 2018, referred to cryptocurrencies
as "digital assets aimed at making purchases, sales, or other financial transactions, are created by
companies or individuals, and are stored electronically in their blockchain, a database that maintains a
permanent record of these digital transactions."

Similarly, in that Opinion, the Superintendency commented on its regulations and whether they can be
offered within Panama. It was stated:

Regarding this, we must state that to date, no regulation considers cryptocurrencies as a "value,"
"money," or electronic currency. Nor is there any Forex regulation using cryptocurrencies, only coins,
and currencies, as an exclusive activity and incidentally of the "Securities Houses"...

"

It is necessary to clarify that currently, this Securities Market Superintendency does not have legal
powers to regulate or supervise these technological platforms. What is regulated and supervised is Forex
activity carried out in Panama or from Panama, so a specific license is not needed to operate such a
platform, but it is needed to operate as a Securities House and thus be able to occasionally carry out
currency and foreign exchange activities. However, it is not possible to use bitcoin as a currency, as it
has not been recognized in our country as currency, foreign exchange, or a valued asset..."

Securities Houses can carry out the typical activities of a Securities House business, which means
receiving, transmitting orders, executing these orders on behalf of third parties, and placing and
executing orders on their behalf. They can also carry out incidental businesses to it, such as investment
advice, discretionary and individualized management of investment accounts according to the mandates
given by investors, and the management of custody accounts. Services that can be provided by
Securities Houses related to rights, securities, or documents that are considered values by the definition
given in Article 49 of the Unified Text of the Securities Market Law (ref. Article 4 of Agreement 2-
2011).

In this regard, in Panama, a Securities House that has a License issued by the Securities Market
Superintendency must provide custody service over securities, either through an individual account or
a global account. Having this clear, a Securities House with a license issued by this Superintendency,
offering custody service within the local market, through a Securities Central or another Securities


=== Page 13 ===

House which in turn keeps custody in a global account with a Securities Central, all with licenses issued
by the Securities Market Superintendency (ref. Article 14-b of Agreement 2-2011), cannot custody
digital assets. According to the parameters established and developed in the securities sector in Panama,
custody must be over securities, which in turn constitutes a type of financial asset according to the
definition given in the Securities Market Law.

However, the Securities Market Law also allows a Securities House to keep custody of its clients'
financial assets through a global account with a foreign custodian and/or through another Securities
House licensed by this Superintendency which, in turn, keeps such custody through a global account
with a foreign custodian. In light of this scenario, the possibilities of custody of digital assets,
considering the use of new technologies, which includes the development of new products, is a scenario
that our regulated subjects must identify and assess their risks, without limiting their responsibility
regarding third parties involved in the provision of services that include new products, new business
practices, and even new technologies (ref. Article -A of Agreement 06-2015). Therefore, the specific
situation should be subject to a deeper analysis that involves the participants in this market and make
adjustments to our current regulations to protect investors.

On the other hand, as established by Article Agreement 2-2011, a Securities House can provide the
Investment Advisor service as an incidental activity. In that sense, a Securities House can offer and
provide the Investment Advisor service as an incidental activity, and in that sense, a Securities House
can offer and provide the investment account management service of its clients maintained with an
intermediary. Considering that the referenced service can be provided in or from Panama, we have two
scenarios: on one hand, if the service is provided in Panama, that is, by a local Securities House that
manages an investment account of a client that is opened and whose assets are held by a local
intermediary, according to our current regulations, such an investment account opened in Panama, must
consist of securities or money, the latter incidentally (ref. Article 64 of the Unified Text of the Securities
Market Law). In that sense, the Securities House can only transmit orders to buy or sell "securities".

Now, if the Securities House is going to provide the management or handling service of an investment
account that was opened in another jurisdiction that allows such accounts to hold and negotiate, in
addition to securities and financial instruments, other types of products, such as a type of digital asset,
as these assets are held in a foreign jurisdiction where the Securities Market Law recognizes the law of
the foreign custodian's jurisdiction, it is necessary to analyze and regulate the aforementioned situation.
We must reiterate to our regulated entities the importance of following the rules that this
Superintendency has issued on money laundering prevention, terrorist financing, and financing of
weapons of mass destruction, as well as documenting the contractual relations of the client with both
the local Securities House and the foreign financial intermediary (ref. Article 21 of Agreement 2-2011).

Regarding the FOREX activity, which constitutes the regular operation of buying and selling currencies
and foreign exchange, which is carried out exclusively by Securities Houses according to our current
regulations in the field of the securities market, as previously cited in Administrative Opinion 7-2018,
this Superintendency indicated that no regulation encompasses cryptocurrencies as a "value", money,
or electronic currency.

Currently, in our country, there is no Forex regulation using cryptocurrencies, and therefore, a Securities
House with a License issued by this Securities Market Superintendency cannot sell or exchange
traditional currencies for digital currencies and vice versa.

Lastly, regarding whether a Securities House can maintain cash positions, in this case, a digital currency,
in a cash account that the Securities Households at a financial institution that operates and is regulated
in a jurisdiction that has recognized digital currency, this Superintendency must reiterate that, currently,


=== Page 14 ===

in our country, the legal treatment to be given to cryptocurrencies has not been defined, consequently,
regulation is required to establish the same, as well as its region.”

This reiterates its position of not being competent to address virtual assets.
In Opinion 5-2023, the following questions are elevated to the SMV:

Subject: A request has been made to the Securities Market Superintendency to issue a formal
Administrative Opinion regarding the obligation of a Panamanian corporation to obtain a license for
conducting certain activities related to cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency derivatives.

Position of the Superintendency: Once the legal bases have been incorporated, it is up to the Securities
Market Superintendency to resolve them in the same order in which they are presented: Our Unified
Text establishes the activities that an investment advisor and brokerage firm may carry out, which in no
legal precept establishes the management of cryptocurrencies, rather, it regulates the matter of
investments or securities intermediation. With the above said, in the legal foundations cited in previous
paragraphs, we can observe that cryptocurrencies do not represent a security or financial instrument,
according to the definition established in our Unified Text, and therefore the activity of buying and
selling or similar activities related to cryptocurrencies, is not an activity regulated by our entity.
Therefore, as long as no Law in the Republic of Panama grants us such power, we cannot legislate on
matters of this nature, and those virtual assets that do not behave as a security will not be under our
authority. However, if the virtual assets are securities similar to the definition established by our Unified
Text in Article 49, this entity will have the authority to regulate them by agreement.

It is necessary to mention that, due to the constant attempts made by the Legislative Body to regulate
this type of activities, the last Bill carried out by said body, Bill No. 697 of 2021 "Which regulates the
commercialization and use of virtual assets and virtual asset service providers, and dictates other
provisions", was declared as inexecutable in its entirety by the Executive Body and, thus confirmed by
the Supreme Court of Justice, through a ruling on June 6, 2023. Having clarified the above points, this
Superintendency about this request for Opinion concludes that, in this particular case, the elements
stated by the applicant as characteristics of the business intended to be carried out, are not subject to
supervision by this Superintendency, nor is it obliged to obtain any license to perform operations with
cryptocurrencies as they are not considered as an activity of the securities market based on the
regulatory framework of the Unified Text of Decree Law 1 of 1999 and its respective agreements and
regulations, nor can brokerage firms according to the regulation and current opinions that this
Superintendency has issued in the past, engage in the business of buying and selling or transactions of
cryptocurrencies.

Regarding the subject of derivatives, we can reference Opinion 4-2024, which analyzed the following
question:

"Can a national brokerage firm hold in a national investment account custody of financial assets other
than those recognized by Panamanian legislation or customary practices as 'securities' or 'money'?"

In this Opinion, the SMV (Superintendency of the Securities Market) specifically addresses the
concept of derivatives, stating that it has previously indicated its authority to issue special regulations
on the matter. However, no agreement regulating this issue has yet been established.

Flipster activities fall outside the scope of Panama's securities regulations. The Superintendence of the
Securities Market has consistently maintained that digital assets and cryptocurrencies do not qualify as
'securities' under Article 49(66) of the Unified Text of the Securities Market Law. Through multiple


=== Page 15 ===

binding opinions, the Superintendence has explicitly stated it lacks jurisdiction over virtual assets unless
they specifically behave as securities under the traditional definition.

Furthermore, the Superintendence has explicitly recognized that activities involving digital assets
require no license or supervision from their authority. This position was most recently reinforced in
Opinion 5-2023, where the Superintendence unequivocally stated that cryptocurrency-related activities
fall outside their regulatory purview.

Given this regulatory landscape, coupled with Panama's constitutional principle that private persons
may engage in activities not expressly prohibited by law (Article 18), Bondi, acting as a platform that
tokenizes securities and offers these tokenized representations, can operate within Panama's legal

framework without requiring specific securities registration or oversight from the Superintendence of
the Securities Market.

G. Opinions of the Superintendency of Banks of Panama (SBP)

The Law Decree 9 of 1998, which governs banking entities in Panama, delineates the scope of its
application in Article 1. This decree applies to banks and individuals conducting banking business
within or from the Republic of Panama, banking groups as defined by the decree and its implementing
regulations, representation offices, and certain non-banking and non-financial affiliates as specified in
Article 63 of the decree.

Article 2 of the decree establishes a crucial regulatory principle, stipulating that only entities in
possession of the requisite banking license are authorized to conduct banking business within or from
the Republic of Panama. This provision extends to public law entities specifically authorized by law to
engage in such activities.

Of particular significance to this legal analysis is Notice 5, 2018, issued by the Superintendency of
Banks of Panama. This notice serves as a cautionary advisory to the public regarding the use of
cryptocurrencies, with specific reference to Bitcoin and similar instruments. The Superintendency
emphasizes the importance of understanding the associated risks when considering the acquisition or
use of such instruments as investments or means of payment within Panama. The notice explicitly
acknowledges the relative novelty of cryptocurrencies and unequivocally states that activities involving
the exchange, investment, buying, selling, and general commercialization of Bitcoin or analogous
instruments are not subject to specific regulations in Panama. Furthermore, the Superintendency
clarifies that such activities fall outside its regulatory purview.

The Superintendency also notes that, as of the notice's issuance, no regulated entities under its
supervision had requested authorization to custody, invest, intermediate, or operate with cryptocurrency
instruments. However, the notice reaffirms that regulated entities are expected to maintain due diligence
measures to prevent misuse of their services and platforms, in accordance with the Banking Law, Law
23 of 2015, Agreement 10 of 2015, and other applicable regulations.

This regulatory stance effectively places cryptocurrency-related activities outside the direct supervisory
scope of the Superintendency of Banks of Panama and only emphasizes the need for caution and risk
awareness among the public engaging with these financial instruments.

H. Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
1. Suspicious transaction reports ("STRs")

The compliance obligations in Panama are grounded in a variety of laws, regulations, and agreements.
Law 23 of April 27, 2015 (the "AML/CFT Law") establishes measures to prevent money laundering,
terrorist financing, and the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Under this
law, obligations are set forth to identify, assess, and understand the risks associated with these illicit
activities and prescribe appropriate controls for their mitigation. Executive Decree 35 of 2022 further
regulates Law 23 of 2015 and dictates other provisions related to the prevention of money laundering
and related activities. Various resolutions and decrees, such as Administrative Resolution 05-2019 of
2019 and Resolution JD-REG-001-18 of 2018, establish specific guidelines and directives for obligated
subjects in the field of prevention and risk control of money laundering and terrorist financing.

Panama has obliged relevant parties to conduct methodologies for the prevention of money laundering,
terrorist financing, and the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are introduced
with a risk-based approach, allowing for the adoption of measures and the allocation of resources
proportionally to the exposure of identified risks.

There is an express obligation to comply with anti-money laundering procedures. Non-financial
obligated subjects, such as legal firms, must document their risk assessments, consider all relevant risk
factors, keep risk assessments up to date, and have appropriate mechanisms to provide information on
risk assessments.

Also, criteria for customer due diligence are established, including verifying the customer's identity
using official documents, data, or information obtained from reliable sources, and conducting a risk
assessment of the customer. An internal control system to comply with the provisions of Law 23 of
2015 is mentioned, including enhanced knowledge of customers classified as politically exposed
persons and the prohibition of establishing relationships or conducting transactions with certain
individuals or entities. These obligations aim to protect the integrity of the financial system and other
sectors of the Panamanian economy, facilitate international cooperation, and ensure effective
prevention of money laundering, terrorist financing, and the financing of the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction.

For this Legal Opinion, it’s of high importance to determine who are the obligated subjects that should
be complying with these regulations.

Law 23 of 2015, "Which adopts measures to prevent money laundering, terrorism financing, and the
financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and dictates other provisions" in Article
2 determines the scope of application, which includes Financial Reporting Entities and Non-Financial
Reporting Entities, who are in turn specifically subject to regulation and registration under AML/CFT
regulation.

Title IV determines who are these Financial Reporting Entities (Sujetos Obligados Financieros) and
Non-Financial Reporting Entities (Sujetos Obligados No Financieros), which are listed below:

Article 23, as amended under Article 123 of Law 21 of 2017, expressly mentions that “Financial
Reporting Entities are:

13. Any other sector that by law is subject to the competence of the Superintendency of Non-
Financial Subjects, as well as other entities and activities that are included by law and that, due
to the nature of their operations, may be used for the commission of the crimes of money
laundering, terrorism financing, or financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, or those that arise from the national risk assessment plan for the prevention of
money laundering, terrorism financing, and financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction.”

According to the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) law, any
sector or activity not expressly delineated within said law shall not be subject to the regulations and
standards prescribed therein for AML/CFT compliance. In other words, entities or operations falling
outside the explicit purview of the AML/CFT law are thereby exempt from adherence to AML/CFT
regulations and standards as stipulated therein. Any ambiguity or uncertainty concerning the
applicability of AML/CFT measures to sectors or activities not specifically enumerated under the
aforementioned laws and regulations shall be resolved in favor of non-application.

Law 23 of 2015 and its implementing regulations establish comprehensive provisions for the prevention
of money laundering, terrorist financing, and the financing of weapons of mass destruction in Panama.
The statute expressly delineates two categories of regulated entities: Financial Reporting Entities and
Non-Financial Reporting Entities, each enumerated exhaustively within Articles 23 and 24 of the law.
The legislature's explicit enumeration of regulated entities operates as a limitation on the law's scope.
Crypto _asssets related platforms, including those that tokenize securities or distribute tokenized
securities, are not designated within either category of regulated entities under Law 23 of 2015, nor are

they captured by subsequent amendments to this legislation. Consequently, entities providing these
services are neither required to register with Panamanian AML authorities nor subject to AML/CFT

supervision or compliance obligations under Panamanian law.

According to Panamanian law, only entities obligated under Law 23 of 2015 (the AML Law) are
required to report to the UAF Panama, which serves as a collecting entity. However, crypto exchanges
services do not fall within the scope of this law—neither as financial subjects nor as non-financial


=== Page 19 ===

subjects. To generate STRs, an entity must possess a UAF code, which a crypto exchange would not
qualify for. Registering a UAF code for this type of business model is atypical and falls outside the
scope of current Panamanian laws and regulations.

Furthermore, the UAF technically lacks the authority to supervise such activities, as outlined in Article
11 of Law 23. The UAF only serves as a collecting body, not a supervisory body. Each subject
(obliged/reporting entity) has its own supervisory body in Panama, for instance, the Superintendency
of Banks for banks, the Superintendency of Securities Markets for capital markets actors,
Superintendency of Insurance for insurance companies, the SSNF for property developers, casinos, and
liberal professions. Given that a crypto exchange business model does not fall under the jurisdiction of
a supervisory entity (e.g., a superintendency), it is likely that a request to submit voluntary STRs cannot
proceed.

This is further confirmed by our correspondence email with the Financial Analysis Unit (UAF), dated
27 December 2024, whereby this Panamanian authority confirm the following:

"Good morning, ,

In response to your inquiry, the Financial Analysis Unit (UAF), as the national center
for the collection and analysis of financial information related to money laundering,
terrorism financing, and the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, as well as for communicating the results of such analysis to the country's
investigative and law enforcement authorities, only receives information from obligated
entities classified as such under Law 23 of April 27, 2015.

Therefore, this entity does not have the authority to receive Suspicious Transaction
Reports (STRs) or Cash Transaction Reports (CTRs) voluntarily from individuals or
legal entities that are not considered financial or non-financial obligated entities, in
accordance with the current regulations aimed at preventing the aforementioned crimes.

Kind regards,

CONTACT CENTER
UAF PANAMA
514-0100 OPTION 1"

Based on the applicable AML legislation and the above confirmation by the UAF, we can confirm, that
a Panamanian entity providing crypto asset-related services: (a_) is not required to register with

Panamanian AML authorities; (b) is not subject to AML/CFT supervision or compliance obligations;

(c) are not subject to mandatory reporting obligations; and (d) cannot voluntarily submit Suspicious
Transaction Reports (STRs) or Cash Transaction Reports (CTRs) to the local financial intelligence unit
(UAF).

2. Sanctions

Panama's sanctions regime is primarily governed by Title VI of Law No. 23 of April 27, 2015,
Executive Decree No. 587 of August 4, 2015, and Resolution No. 01-018 of March 27, 2018, issued
by the National Commission against Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Financing of the
Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (CNBC). Under this framework:

e Restrictive Lists: Lists against which reporting entities and professionals that carry out activities
subject to supervision shall refrain from conducting transactions or shall seek to terminate their
commercial relationships to the extent legally possible, with the natural or legal persons listed
therein. Restrictive lists are considered to be those issued by the United Nations Security


=== Page 20 ===

Council (hereinafter UN List), in accordance with the provisions of United Nations Security
Council Resolutions S/RES/1267, S/RES/1988, S/RES/1373, S/RES/1718, S/RES/1737 and all
their successors, or other resolutions that may be issued on this matter; as well as those lists
that may be established by law from time to time.

Restrictive Lists are binding for the Republic of Panama in accordance with International Law
norms as established in Article 4 of the Political Constitution of the Republic.

e Control Lists: Lists used for the effective administration of money laundering, terrorist
financing and financing of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction risks. These are lists
different from restrictive lists and involve the classification of the person (natural or legal),
country, territory or jurisdiction as high risk for money laundering and/or terrorist financing.

Under Panama's regulatory framework, established by Law 23 of 2015, Executive Decree 587 of 2015,
and Guide No. I-REG-002-18 of October 4, 2018, the country maintains a clear distinction between
binding restrictive lists and reference control lists. Panama legally binds itself exclusively to the United
Nations Security Council Consolidated Sanctions List, which includes UN Security Council
Resolutions S/RES/1267, S/RES/1988, S/RES/1373, S/RES/1718, S/RES/1737, and their successors.
This binding nature is explicitly established in accordance with Article 4 of the Political Constitution
of the Republic of Panama and requires regulated entities to implement immediate preventive freezing
measures upon identification of any match.

International sanctions lists such as US OFAC, UK Treasury, and other regimes are incorporated into
the supervisory framework as "Control Lists," alongside other reference tools including the FATF High-
Risk Jurisdictions List, Basel AML Index, and Transparency International Corruption Index. These
control lists, while not formally adopted by law, are actively enforced through Panama's supervisory
authorities, requiring regulated entities to implement comprehensive risk-based measures and enhanced
due diligence when dealing with listed persons or entities.

Pursuant to Law 23 of 2015, Executive Decree 587 of 2015, and Guide No. I-REG-002-18 of October
4, 2018, Panama maintains a two-tiered sanctions compliance framework:

1. Legally Binding Framework: Under Panamanian law, only the UN Security Council
Consolidated Sanctions List constitutes a mandatory restrictive list ("Lista Restrictiva"),
requiring: (a) Immediate preventive asset freezing; (b) Mandatory screening through UAF
online system within 12 hours; (c) Judicial verification by the Second Chamber of Criminal
Affairs of the Supreme Court; (d) Prohibition of transactions with listed persons/entities.

2. Reference Framework: Control Lists ("Listas de Control") are defined as tools for risk
assessment and enhanced due diligence, including:

a. International Organizations' Lists:
i. FATF High-Risk Jurisdictions List
li. Basel AML Index
iii. Transparency International Corruption Index
iv. European Union Consolidated List
b. Country-Specific Lists:
i. United States (OFAC) Lists:
1. Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers (SDNT)
2. Significant Foreign Narcotics Traffickers (SFNT)
3. Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT)
4. Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN)
ii. United Kingdom - Consolidated List of Financial Sanctions Targets
ili. Canada (OSFI) - Lists under Criminal Code subsection 83.05(1)
c. National Lists:
i. CNBC Resolution 02-018 (Venezuelan PEPs)


=== Page 21 ===

In practice, supervisory authorities have established the following sanction lists as mandatory screening
requirements:

e United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UN):

Atualizado-al-25-de-julio-de-2024.pdf

Based on the previous analysis of Panamanian regulations, we conclude that Bondi is not required to
comply with local compliance reporting in this matter. Furthermore, a recent inquiry made by Pacifica
Legal to the Unidad de Analisis Financiero (UAF) or Financial Analysis Unit, confirmed that entities
not legally obligated to comply with these regulations cannot voluntarily do so. The UAF does not
allow voluntary reporting in such cases.

I. Commercial License (Notice of Operation)

Also as part of the Commercial Regulation, the Law 5 of 2007, streamlines the company opening
process and establishes other provisions, and establishes that “every individual or legal entity may
conduct commercial or industrial activities within the national territory, subject to what is established
in the present Law and its regulations and with the limitations set by the Political Constitution; therefore,
no public servant may oppose the operation of a business that has met all legal requirements."

Therefore, Panamanian legal entities engaged in business outside of Panamanian territory are not
required to obtain a commercial license in the Republic or comply with local regulations that could
apply to those engaging in business from Panama.

J. Other Considerations

Bill No. 697 of 2021 which “regulates the Market and Use of Virtual Assets and the Providers of Virtual
Asset Services and enacts other provisions”, was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of
Justice, in a ruling dated June 6, 2023, this bill had been approved in a third debate by the National
Assembly during its session on October 28, 2022.

The decision, in essence, states: “The entire Bill No. 697 of 2021 is unconstitutional since its approval
by the National Assembly did not comply with the parameters established for the formation of Laws by
the Constitution, specifically Article 170.”, it had reached the Supreme Court because President,
exercising his constitutional powers, raised an unconstitutionality objection against it.


=== Page 22 ===

As indicated by the dissenting opinion of Justice Olmedo Arrocha, one of the members of the Supreme
Court, stated that this activity; that is, the purchase of cryptocurrencies and tokenization of assets, is
neither regulated nor prohibited. Being unregulated, it will be an activity that does not offer guarantees
to consumers and will be governed by trust, moral controls, market rules, and general legal principles.

V. Conclusions
Analyzing the inquiries that were presented initially in the Legal Opinion, I can conclude with the
following statements:

1. Whether engaging in custodial or non-custodial crypto asset services, including, but not
limited to, the conversion of crypto assets to fiat currency, fiat currency to crypto assets,
and the conversion of one crypto asset to another constitutes a regulated activity under
the laws of the Republic of Panama and is subject to licensing or regulatory requirements.

Based on our analysis of Panamanian law and the positions taken by regulatory authorities, including
the Superintendency of Banks (SBP) and the Superintendency of Securities Market (SMV), I conclude
crypto assets transaction services, including the conversion of cryptocurrency to fiat currency, fiat
currency to cryptocurrency and the conversion of one cryptocurrency into another cryptocurrency, do
not constitute a regulated activity under Panamanian law. The absence of explicit regulation governing
cryptocurrencies and related activities further supports this conclusion.

Panama currently has no Virtual Asset Services Provider (VASP) regime or regulatory framework that
governs cryptocurrencies or crypto-related activities.

2. Whether the tokenization of securities and the offering or distribution of tokenized
securities constitute a regulated activity under the laws of the Republic of Panama and
are subject to licensing or regulatory requirements.

Panama’s regulatory framework, including financial, banking, and securities laws does not encompass
or impose specific regulatory obligations on companies engaged solely in such crypto-assets transaction
services, or any tokenization of securities. Accordingly, no licensing requirements apply to the
provision of these services under existing Panamanian law.

Furthermore, both the Superintendency of Banks (SBP) and the Superintendency of Securities Market
(SMV) have affirmed through multiple formal opinions that, in the absence of relevant regulation, these
authorities lack the jurisdiction and authority to oversee, regulate, or issue any form of license for crypto
-assets-related services. Until such laws are properly approved, these governmental entities are unable
to exercise oversight or provide licensing for the mentioned activities.

3. Whether a Panamanian legal entity providing a platform for custodial or non-custodial
crypto asset transaction services or a securities tokenization platform is subject to
Panamanian anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT) regulations, including whether such entities are required to register with or
be overseen by Panamanian AML authorities.

Law 23 of 2015 and its implementing regulations establish an exhaustive list of entities subject to anti-
money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism obligations in Panama. Platforms relating
to crypto assets, including the tokenization of securities and distribution of tokenized securities, are not
designated as either Financial Reporting Entities or Non-Financial Reporting Entities under this

legislation. Consequently, entities providing cryptocurrency trading services are not required to register
with Panamanian AML authorities and are not subject to AML/CFT supervision or compliance
obligations. The statutory framework does not grant regulatory authorities jurisdiction over crypto-
related activities absent explicit legislative authorization.

4. Whether listing Bondi's offered services and products within a mobile application on the
Apple App Store and Google Play Store requires any regulatory requirements, licenses,
or approvals.

Activities relating to crypto assets, including the tokenization of securities and distribution of tokenized
securities, and, consequently, the listing of a mobile application on the Apple App Store and Google
Play Store, do not require any license or approval from local authorities; this means they can be freely
listed without further local requirements as mobile applications.

It is important to mention that these conclusions apply only to the laws of Panama and_don’t exempt
Bondi from reviewing the local regulations of any other jurisdiction that may be applicable to it.

These conclusions reflect our current legal framework, the regulatory landscape for virtual assets is
dynamic and evolving. Future legislation or regulatory guidance could modify these positions.
