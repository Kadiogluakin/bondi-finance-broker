Current State of Corporate 
Bonds in Emerging Markets  
Current Trends 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, countries, particularly the US, applied quantitative easing and 
economic stimulus policies to minimize the economic shrinkage caused by lockdowns and 
capital flight. The M2 money supply of the US, which is the FED’s estimate for all cash in the 
economy except for large institutional deposits, jumped 42.2% from $15.38 trillion in the 
beginning of 2020 to $21.722 trillion at its peak in April 2022. While all this money that was 
pushed into circulation via very low interest bank loans and stimulus checks provided people 
with the much needed cash to keep the cogs of the economy moving, it also resulted in the 
inevitable consequence of inflation. Central banks responded by raising interest rates to cool 
down inflation without causing another recession, a strategy known as a “soft landing.”

In this environment of raised interest rates, US Treasury bonds, regarded as the only “risk-free” 
US dollar-denominated asset class, started offering investors up to a 5% annual yield on 10-
year-maturity bonds. This risk-free return made cash and cash equivalents more attractive to 
investors, resulting in a significant shift of capital from equity markets into cash and cash 
equivalents like Money Market Funds and US Treasuries. The market cap of Money Market 
Funds increased from $5.03 trillion in 2022 to $6.35 trillion in 2023, a rise of more than 26%. 
Despite the attractiveness of money markets and US Treasuries, their returns pale in 
comparison to those from emerging market bonds.


Investment Grade Emerging Market Bonds 
From March 2022 to May 2024, the average yield for 5-year maturity U.S. Treasuries was 
3.79% per annum. In contrast, investment-grade emerging market corporate bonds (IGEMCB), 
listed in the ICE BofA High Grade Emerging Markets Corporate Plus Index, offered an average 
yield of 5.41%. This represents a significant 42.7% risk premium over U.S. Government debt, 
while still being relatively safe assets. According to S&P, the default rate for investment-grade 
emerging market corporate bonds averaged 0.07% annually and 0.28% over a cumulative 2-
year period between 1981 and 2023. Notably, no investment-grade corporate bonds defaulted 
in 2022 and 2023.


High-Yield Emerging Market Bonds 
For high-yield emerging market bonds, the average yield during the same period was 10.11%, 
as reported by the ICE BofA High Yield Emerging Markets Corporate Plus Index. This indicates 
that these high-risk assets returned an 86.8% higher yield compared to their investment-grade 
counterparts and 166% more than 5-year U.S. Treasuries. The historical default rate for these 
securities was 2.58% annually from 1981 to 2023, with a cumulative 2-year default rate of 
4.97%. Notably, the annual default rates in 2022 and 2023 were lower than average, at 2.38% 
and 2.1% respectively, resulting in a 4.43% cumulative default rate for this period. Despite the 
higher risk, the substantial yield offered by speculative-grade corporate bonds in emerging 
markets highlights their potential for investors seeking higher returns.

Investment Grade US Corporate Bonds 
Investment grade debt issued by US corporations also shows interesting trends. The average 
5-Year High Quality Market (HQM) Corporate Bond Par Yield for AAA, AA, and A rated firms  
has been 4.68% since March 2022. The ICE BofA BBB US Corporate Index, which includes the 
lowest level investment grade US Corporate Bonds, returned an average yield of 5.52% during 
the same period. Combining these yields, the average for US investment grade corporate debt 
is 5.1%, which is 5.7% less than the 5.41% offered by their emerging market counterparts. 
Despite the lower risk premium against US Treasuries, US corporations historically had a higher 
default rate of 0.11% annually and a 0.28% cumulative 2-year default rate, meaning they had a 
57.1% higher annual default risk compared to their emerging market counterparts.

The average credit quality of the investment-grade corporate bond market has been improving 
as well. In the years following the global financial crisis, the share of BBB2 rated bonds steadily 
increased, rising from the 33% area all the way to 52% in 2021. That has since reversed, with 
BBB rated corporates making up 47% of the Bloomberg US Corporate Bond Index, while the A 
rated bond share has increased to 45%. BBBs still make up the largest share compared to 
AAA, AA, and A rated bonds, but it's a step in the right direction, as the implied credit risk of 
the index is lower today than it was a few years ago.

High-Yield US Corporate Bonds 
According to the ICE BofA US High Yield Index, the average yield for high-yield US corporate 
debt  has been 8.07% since March 2022. This is 20.2% less than the average annual yield for 
high-yield emerging market bonds. The historical default rate for US high-yield corporate 
bonds is significantly higher at 3.95% annually and 7.7% over a 2-year period since 1981. 
These figures are 53% and 54.9% higher compared to high-yield emerging market bonds, 
respectively. Despite paying lower yields, US high-yield bonds have a higher default rate, 
making them riskier investments than their emerging market counterparts.

The Rise of Emerging Market Bonds 

In 2023, credit rating transitions for emerging market corporate bonds, excluding "not rated" 
(NR) ones, generally trended upwards across all levels. A prolonged high interest rate 
environment, lasting over a year and a half, did not diminish these firms' ability to meet their 
obligations.

2023 One - year Corporate Transition Rates for Emerging Markets (%)

Despite high interest rates, the global economy has demonstrated resilience since the 
beginning of 2024, with an expected growth rate of 3.1% for the year, matching 2023's growth. 
Additionally, the OECD unemployment rate was 4.9% in February 2024, maintaining its lowest 
levels since 2001.

Notably, leading emerging market economies are driving growth, with India, Indonesia, China, 
and Turkey being the only G20 countries expected to exceed the global average growth rate.

Strong growth and fundamentals have made emerging market bonds, especially high-yield 
ones, more attractive, resulting in their outperformance compared to other bond classes. 

As the global economy continues to display a positive outlook and faith on a “soft landing” still 
hasn’t diminished, debt payment abilities of sovereigns and corporates are perceived to be 
elevated. The IMF and other international lenders have supported high-default-risk sovereigns, 
leading to increased liquidity for both sovereign and corporate bonds in these countries. 
Furthermore, reforms in countries like Turkey and Argentina are strengthening the overall 
market fundamentals. All in all, 2024 appears to be a transformational year loaded with 
opportunities in bond markets.

Summarizing the Findings 
Emerging-market (EM) corporate bonds offer a noteworthy investment opportunity, but carry a 
risk premium as their origin countries are viewed as volatile in economic and political stability. 
However, the fundamentals of EM corporates are generally stronger compared to their 
developed-market counterparts. For instance, EM corporate net leverage ratios are lower than 
those of US corporates, while their cash reserves are higher.

Additionally, EM corporate bonds consistently provide higher yields and have a solid track 
record of low default rates. On average, investment grade EM corporate debt yields 6.8%, 
2
which matches high-yield US corporate debt and is nearly two percentage points higher than 
the yield of the investment-grade US corporate bond market. High-yield EM bonds offer even 
greater returns, surpassing their US counterparts by a good margin.

Risk Less, Earn More with Bondi 
The current crypto landscape lacks assets that can provide investors with stable and high 
yields. The values of crypto assets are highly linked to each other and follow crypto cycles 
which are highly sentimental. While lending markets have proven to be a reliable medium to 
invest stablecoins, their returns are unpredictable and follow general crypto trends.

There is a whole world of assets whose performance are independent of crypto trends. The 
tokenization of traditional financial instruments allow crypto investors to diversify their portfolio 
without having to trade their crypto assets for fiat money. Tokenized treasuries have kickstarted 
the process and provide crypto users with stable yields. However, their low yields, even at 
unusually high rates for recent history eliminate them as a viable contender for the rates that 
crypto investors have gotten used to. With the recent US economic data anticipated to push 
the FED to lower interest rates, their viability is only projected to decrease in the medium term.

EM corporate bonds have a proven track record of being solid instruments to get a steady 
cash flow. Unfortunately, the investment thresholds are extremely high for this asset class, 
acting as barriers against retail investors who could benefit from buying them. Bondi makes 
buying EM corporate bonds as simple as it gets, lifting the barriers and helping democratize 
finance.
