3. Description of Services 
Overview 
Bondi Finance provides a platform that enables eligible Users to 
participate in the tokenization of corporate bonds. Our services 
include:

•Issuance (Minting) of Bond Tokens: Facilitating the creation 
of digital tokens that represent corporate bonds.


•Redemption of Bond Tokens: Allowing the redemption of 
Bond Tokens at the maturity of the underlying bonds.

•Processing Coupon Payments: Distributing periodic coupon 
payments to Bond Token holders, net of applicable fees.

Platform Role 
Bondi acts solely as a developer and provider of the software 
platform. All transactions are executed on a public blockchain via 
Users' self-custodial wallets. Bondi does not operate as a digital 
asset or derivatives exchange and does not provide trade 
execution or clearing services. Instead, all secondary 
transactions are executed peer-to-peer directly between Users' 
blockchain addresses, subject to applicable freezing or forced-
transfer measures for suspicious or blacklisted accounts as set 
forth in our internal policies.

4. Disclaimers and Important Notices 
Software and Service Disclaimer 
Bondi is the developer and owner of the software that powers the 
Platform. However, Bondi does not operate a digital asset 
exchange or offer trade execution or clearing services.

•User Transactions: All transactions involving Bond Tokens 
occur directly on a public blockchain and are executed via 
Users' self-custodial wallets. Bondi has no control over the 
underlying blockchain protocols and does not intervene in 
the execution of these transactions.

•Limited Control Measures: While Bondi cannot restrict 
access to self-custodial wallets, we reserve the right to 
freeze or force-transfer Bond Tokens from wallets identified 

as suspicious or that are blacklisted, in accordance with our 
security and compliance policies.

No Financial Solicitation 
The information contained on this Platform and its associated 
websites is provided for informational purposes only and is not 
intended to solicit, offer, or provide any financial product or 
service directly.

Regulatory Status of Bond Tokens 
Bond Tokens have not been and will not be registered under the 
U.S. Securities Act of 1933 or any other securities regulatory 
authority. Accordingly, Bond Tokens may not be offered, sold, or 
delivered to U.S. persons or for their benefit, and may be 
available only to Users who are non-U.S. persons, subject to 
applicable laws.

"As Is" and "As Available" Basis 
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Platform, its 
software, and the Services are provided on an "as is" and "as 
available" basis without any representations, warranties, or 
conditions of any kind, whether express or implied.

•No Warranty: Bondi expressly disclaims all warranties, 
including but not limited to the implied warranties of 
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, 
security, availability, reliability, accuracy, and non-
infringement.

•No Guarantee of Uninterrupted Service: Bondi does not 
guarantee that the Platform or Services will be 
uninterrupted, error-free, or secure. Bondi shall not be liable 

for any loss or damage arising from the use or inability to 
use the Platform, including but not limited to data loss, 
system failures, or force majeure events.

5. Fees and Payment Terms 
Minting Fee 
When new Bond Tokens are issued, a Minting Fee of 0.2% of the 
total token value will be automatically deducted from the 
transaction amount.

Redemption Fee 
Upon redemption of Bond Tokens at maturity, a Redemption Fee 
of 0.2% of the redemption value will be applied and deducted 
from the proceeds.

Coupon Fee 
Each coupon payment processed through the Platform will incur 
a Coupon Fee of 0.2%, deducted from the gross coupon amount 
before distribution to Bond Token holders.

Fee Adjustments 
Bondi reserves the right to modify the fee structure upon 
providing advance notice through the Platform. Continued use of 
the Platform after such modifications constitutes acceptance of 
the updated fees.

Non-Refundable Nature 

All fees are non-refundable once processed as part of a 
transaction.

6. User Obligations and Account 
Security 
Accuracy and Completeness 
Users shall provide accurate, current, and complete information 
when registering or interacting with the Platform. Inaccurate or 
incomplete information may result in suspension or termination of 
access.

Self-Custodial Wallet Responsibility 
Since all Bond Tokens are transacted on a public blockchain via 
Users' self-custodial wallets, each User is solely responsible for 
the security, control, and backup of their wallet credentials and 
private keys. Bondi Technology Inc. shall have no liability for any 
loss, theft, or compromise arising from the User's failure to 
maintain adequate security.

Compliance with Applicable Laws 
Users agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, 
including but not limited to Panamanian financial regulations and 
any other legal requirements in their jurisdiction. Users are solely 
responsible for determining the legal status of using the Platform 
in their respective locales.

Security and Prohibited Conduct 

Users must maintain the confidentiality of their account and 
wallet information. Any unauthorized use of an account is the 
sole responsibility of the User. Bondi Technology Inc. reserves 
the right, in its discretion, to freeze or force-transfer Bond Tokens 
from any wallet identified as suspicious or subject to blacklisting 
pursuant to our internal security and compliance protocols.

understand and assume all risks associated with the issuance, 
management, and trading of Bond Tokens. Bondi Technology Inc. 
shall not be liable for any losses incurred as a result of these 
risks, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

8. Intellectual Property and Proprietary 
Rights

compliance policies.
